# Store

 -  `The store combines the whole application state into a single entity, acting as a database for the web application`
 -  ` Like a traditional database represents the point of record for an application, your store can be thought of as a client-side ‘single source of truth’ or database`

# Reducer

- - `If the store is the database of the application, the reducers are the tables. A reducer is a pure function that accepts two parameters, an action and the previous state with a type and optional data associated with the event.`

- # State
- - `State is a single immutable data structure.`

  # Actions
  - `Actions represent payloads of information that are dispatched to the store from the application and are usually triggered by user interaction.`
